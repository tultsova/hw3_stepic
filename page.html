 <div> <h1 id="probl">The Problem</h1>
     <p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.</p>
         <p>What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.</p>
     <p>But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:</p>
         <p>An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.</p>

        <p> Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</p>
