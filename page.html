    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell
        your most personal data.</p>
    <p>What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry
        monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.</p>
    <p>But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:</p>
    <p>An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated
        scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.</p>
    <p> Put even simpler — <b>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</b></p>

<blockquote>We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a network to make the strongest supercomputer the
    world has ever seen.</blockquote>
